Architecture
Architecture put in place

React Native is a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications, while Firebase is a comprehensive cloud-based platform for developing and managing mobile and web applications. Here is a typical architecture for a project that uses both React Native and Firebase:

Front-end: The front-end of the application is built using React Native.React Native is used to create the user interface and handle user interactions. The app is designed using components that can be reused across platforms.Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps that run on Android, iOS, and the web.

Back-end: The back-end of the application is powered by Firebase. Firebase provides various services like authentication, real-time database, storage, cloud functions, and more. These services can be integrated into the application to provide the necessary functionality.
APIs: Firebase provides APIs that can be used to interact with Firebase services from the client-side code.

Overall, the architecture of a React Native and Firebase project involves a front-end built using React Native and a back-end powered by Firebase. Firebase provides services like Authentication, Realtime Database, Storage, and Cloud Functions that can be integrated into the application to provide the necessary functionality.

Technologies Used:
React Native,
Firebase(NoSQL),
Expo
